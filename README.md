Simple, braindead Krita script used to batch export an open Krita document (.kra) to WEBP format in specific sizes. I used this for generating responsive images to be used in `srcset` inside HTML documents to be deployed to my image-heavy static website.

*Note: this probably does not work with Krita CLI*
